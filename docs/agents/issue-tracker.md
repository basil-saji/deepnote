# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**: `gh issue create --parent <parent> ...`, or `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>` (database id, as in **Blocking** below). Without sub-issues, put `Part of #<parent>` at the top of the child body.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. Create it with `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.

- **Child ticket**: link it to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add it to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Use labels `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, assign it to the driving developer.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub native issue dependencies with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`. Where dependencies aren't available, use `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker or assignee, and take the first in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the issue, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
